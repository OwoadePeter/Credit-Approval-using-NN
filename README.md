Credit Approval Prediction using Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier

Credit approval is the process a business or an individual undergoes to become eligible for a loan or pay for goods and services over an extended period [1]. This work hopes to predict which individual should be approved for loans based on some related features. This is a classification problem, and a neural network-based model is used to make the prediction. The performance of a baseline model as well as a hyperparameter tuned model is computed and the best performing model is identified. Visualization of the performance of the models is also presented.
